# LaneBattleship

A project for my C++ 1 class. The assignment was to make a game similar to battleship/minesweeper, and have an AI that plays it.
This was my first major project in C++ so a lot of time was spent figuring out how to set things up the way I wanted.

The AI is pretty inefficient, which is disappointing, but I think that is more a result of the game's rules than poor AI design.
And the game's rules were part of the project instructions so I can't change that.
