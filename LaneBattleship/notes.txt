just an ai vs a randomly generated board.

board is a 2d array 8x8.
randomly choose some points from that array to place ships.

maybe two arrays. one to hold ships and one to hold guesses. like the real game.

ship array needs 3 states: water, ship, destroyed. maybe just water/ship. depends on which would be easier.
water/ship/destroyed/guessed? mostly for display purposes.

guess array needs 5 states: unknown, miss, hit, near miss (unfound), near miss (found)
near miss has two states so the ai knows if it should keep guessing around there or not.
instructions just say "adjacent" . im gonna say near miss counts diagnols 

ai state machine:

search: check random unknown spots each turn.

hunt: check cardinal directions around a near miss (unfound) square. if you find a ship around a near miss (unfound), make it near miss(found).
save the currently hunted near miss square coords between turns so we can keep checking until it is done.
